A strategy which leverages the phenomenon of a Short Squeeze-
A short squeeze is something which happens cos of a sudden rise in the price of a security which was not expected from trend analysis.
Such a situtaion cause a panic selling among the traders who are short on that particular instrument and try to close their
position as soon as possible to avoid further loss.
To leverage such a situation we need many things-
i. Need to keep track of trend of the instrument's price/performance(the slope of the decline in this case i.e keep track of steepness
of the slope)
ii. Need to keep a close look at the the Short Interest Ratio of the instrument under interest,this is the most critical step
iii. Need to find the driving factors for the decline and also identify potential driving factors for the proposed imminent decline in the price.
