A stunning example this year was Restoration Hardware / RH. The stock bottomed below 25, and lots of people were short after the business model changed to become less promotional and execution was not as good as it could have been. The CEO’s compensation was tied to the share price, which is one reason he may have been drawn to a plan to increase free cash flow by reducing inventory and slowing expansion, and using the proceeds and some newly issued debt to buy back half the outstanding shares. After the buyback and improved performance the stock topped $100/share, creating one long painful squeeze for those who were short. RH has been on the list of high short interest stocks for most of 2017 and each piece of positive news would push the stock up quite a lot, partly because shorts needed to cover — so this squeeze has been ongoing for most of 2017. Here’s a graphic that shows how the buyback affected the short interest % and how short sellers have been covering:
